# Yhemi-Node
This is a basic Node.js script that creates a simple HTTP server and responds with "Hello World!" on port 8080. It demonstrates a fundamental building block for web development using Node.js.

Requirements:

Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system. You can download them from the official Node.js website: https://nodejs.org/en
Installation:

Clone or download this repository.
Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
Run npm install (or yarn install) to install any required dependencies.
Usage:

Run the server using node server.js (replace server.js with your actual file name if it's different).
Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080. You should see "Hello World!" displayed.
Explanation:

var http = require('http');: This line imports the built-in http module from Node.js, which provides functionalities for creating HTTP servers.
http.createServer(function (req, res) { ... }): This line creates an HTTP server using the http.createServer method. The function passed as an argument defines how the server will respond to incoming HTTP requests.
req: This parameter represents the incoming HTTP request object containing information about the request (e.g., method, headers, URL).
res: This parameter represents the outgoing HTTP response object that allows you to send data back to the client.
res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/html'});: This line sets the response headers for the response object. It sets the status code to 200 (OK) and the Content-Type header to text/html, indicating that the response body is plain HTML text.
res.write('Hello World!');: This line writes the string "Hello World!" to the response body.
res.end();: This line signals the end of the response and sends the data back to the client.
.listen(8080);: This method starts listening for incoming HTTP requests on port 8080. You can change the port number to another available port if needed.
